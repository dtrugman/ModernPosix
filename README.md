# C++ Modern POSIX wrappers

## Motivation

Over the years, I have met many programmers that complain about using the POSIX API in CPP.

Every time they tried to integrate it into their projects the results were real nasty.

This led me into writing this library, so that anyone can have a much more intuitive API to the most common methods.

## Notes

**The wrapper classes do NOT provide additional thread-safety over the existing API**

## Process open (popen) wrapper

Following the CPP naming convention, I use the name pstream as in 'Process stream'.

We have two different pstreams, an input stream (ipstream) and an output stream (opstream).

The streams handle the underlying file descriptors and spare the hassle from you (the programmer).

### Input process stream (ipstream) example

The following snippet executes the 'ls -l' command and stores the output into a vector of strings.

Find some working examples @ examples/pstream.cpp. Simple usage example:

```cpp
mp::ipstream reader("ls -l");

vector<string> output;
reader >> output;
```

### Output process stream (opstream) example

The following snippet executes the 'wall' broadcast command and writes a message.

Upon destruction the writer closes the stream and flushes the content.

Find some working examples @ examples/pstream.cpp. Simple usage example:

```cpp
mp::opstream writer("wall");

writer << "testing" << " " << "modern output popen" << "\n";
```

## Dynamic library wrapper

This class simply wraps the dlopen(), dlsym(), dlclose() & dlerror() APIs, allowing easy access to dynamic libraries.

The class assures that the library is closed upon destruction.

You can also specify the type of initilization you require upon construction, default is LAZY and LOCAL, see `man dlopen(3)` for more information.

Find some working examples @ examples/dynamiclib.cpp. Simple usage example:

```cpp
try
{
    mp::dynamiclib dlib(TEST_LIB_C);
    Multiply multiply = (Multiply)dlib.symbol(TEST_LIB_C_MULTIPLY);
    multiply(a,b);
}
catch (std::runtime_error & ex)
{
    // Something went wrong and ex.what() will tell you what it is
}
```

## Directory stream wrapper

This class simply wraps the opendir(), readdir(), rewinddir() & closedir() APIs, allowing easy access to directory entry enumeration.

It assures proper handling of the underlying resources upon destruction.

Find some working examples @ examples/dstream.cpp. Simple usage example:

```cpp
try
{
    mp::idstream ds(TEST_DIR);
    set<string> output;
    ds >> output;
}
```

## Installation
